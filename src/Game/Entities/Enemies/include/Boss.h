// Boss: Implement a Boss class. This class must inherit from the Enemy
// class. Bosses appear in an Area after all other Enemies of that area are
// defeated. A Boss Battle must have at least two phases. That is to say, you
// must deplete the Bossâ€™s health bar twice in order to beat them. Defeating
// a Boss moves the Player to the next Area or a Win State if there are no
// remaining Areas. You must have at least one Boss instance per Area of
// the game
