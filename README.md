# PA1: Particle System
This project is based on the OpenFrameworks Particle example.
 This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course.
 The purpose of this project is to help the student create practical programming skills by implementing
 changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class.

## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's "apps/myApps/" directory
2. Run the command "make" in the terminal or the "Build" Task in VSCode.

## Submitting Assignment
To submit this assignment, create a Release with the branch that holds all the changes you have added. If no Release is made,
the last commit to the master branch will be graded.

Don't forget that you must also fill out an evaluation form in Moodle to consider the project submitted.

## Grading
You will only be graded for specs that were completed.

Any project that doesn't compile will receive a 0.

If a partner has no commits in the repositories, he will receive a 0.

## Student Notes
If you have any notes to add for your TA about the project specs or creative additions, you may do so in this section of the README

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p><b><i>USE MASTER BRANCH</b></i></p>

<b>Phase 1 Explanation</b>
<p>+ Pressing <code>"t"</code> toggles between colors <code>[red, green, blue]</code> in that secuence. <i>(Partner A)</i> </p>
<p>+ Pressing <code>"s"</code> freezes the particles(pause the simulation). <i>(Partner B)</i> </p>
<p>+ Pressing <code>"d"</code> increases velocity by x2 and Pressing <code>"a"</code> decreases velocity by x1/2. <i>(Partner B)</i> </p>

<b>Phase 2 Explanation</b>
<p>+ By left clicking in the screen and dragging the mouse, you can select a portion of the screen in which any particle that enters it will be magnified by x3. <i>(Partner A)</i> </p>
<p>+ You can undo this selection by right clicking inside the rectangle. <i>(Partner A)</i></p>

<b>Phase 3 Explanation</b>
<details> <summary>Details about implementation in this phase</summary>
<ol>
<li>This was designed using a class, implemented by <i>(Partner A).</i></li>
<li><i>(Partner B)</i> Implemented the built functions from this class to the main proyect to record the keys.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<p>+ You can record the keys that were pressed by pressing <code>"r"</code>. An indicator will appear letting you know that you are recording the keys.</p>
<p>+ You can stop the recording by pressing again <code>"r"</code>. The indicator will disapear when you stop recording.</p>
<p>+ Pressing <code>"p"</code> will replay the leatest record you did.</p>
<p>+ Pressing <code>"c"</code> will cancel the replay.</p>
<p>+ An indicator will also appear for when you are replaying.</p>


<b>Bonus Explanation</b>
<p>+ You can enable the <code>"drag magnifier"</code> by pressing <code>"l"</code> to activate the movement of the magnifier box.If you left click inside the area of the rectangle, you can drag it anywhere inside the screen.<i> (Partner A)</i></p>
