# PA2: SPOOKY-QUEST
This project is based on the OpenFrameworks Spooky-Quest videogame example.
 This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course.
 The purpose of this project is to help the student create practical programming skills by implementing
 changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class.
 
<h3>How to use</h3>
